<p align="center">My name is Kelly and I'm an upcoming third year Cognitive Science major at Cal. I'm interested in design,
  whether it's designing logos or websites. I am interested in helping design for a startup that I can see myself and
  the average person using in daily life. This page is a good indicator of my skills up to now, and I am still in the process
  of learning how to create graphics using Adobe Illustrator, as well as design for the web. <p>
