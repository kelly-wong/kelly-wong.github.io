<p align="center">My name is Kelly and I'm an upcoming third year Cognitive Science major at Cal. I like to eat, brunch, shop, (try to) cook, watch 90's rom coms,
  listen to oldies music, write fiction, and design graphics. Below you can learn more about me! I have attached my minted webpage where you can see some of the
  art designs I have done in the past. Toodles! <p>
