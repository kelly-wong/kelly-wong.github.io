<p align="center">Hello my name is Kelly, and I currently studying Cognitive Science and Education at UC Berkeley.
  I like to eat, brunch, cook, watch 90's rom coms, listen to oldies music, write fiction, and design graphics.
  I am fascinated with human development and teaching, as well as the power of technology and how it can be incorporated in public education
  to enhance student learning as well as growth.
  Below you can learn more about me!
  I have also included my minted webpage where you can see some of the art designs I have done in the past.
  Feel free to check that out!    <p>
